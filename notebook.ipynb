Someday, I hope, \\nit will be just as common that people know how to write code, specifically for AI.\\nSeveral hundred years ago, society didn’t view language literacy as a necessary skill. A small \\nnumber of people learned to read and write, and everyone else let them do the reading and \\nwriting. It took centuries for literacy to spread, and now society is far richer for it.\\nWords enable deep human-to-human communication. Code is the deepest form of human-to-\\nmachine communication. As machines become more central to daily life, that communication \\nbecomes ever more important.\\nTraditional software engineering — writing programs that explicitly tell a computer sequences \\nof steps to execute — has been the main path to code literacy. Many introductory programming \\nclasses use creating a video game or building a website as examples. But AI, machine learning, \\nand data science offer a new paradigm in which computers extract knowledge from data. This \\ntechnology offers an even better pathway to coding.\\nMany Sundays, I buy a slice of pizza from my neighborhood pizza parlor. The gentleman \\nbehind the counter has little reason to learn how to build a video game or write his own \\nwebsite software (beyond personal growth and the pleasure of gaining a new skill).\\nBut AI and data science have great value even for a pizza maker. A linear regression model might \\nenable him to better estimate demand so he can optimize the restaurant’s staffing and supply \\nchain. He could better predict sales of Hawaiian pizza — my favorite! — so he could make more \\nHawaiian pies in advance and reduce the amount of time customers had to wait for them.\\nUses of AI and data science can be found in almost any situation that produces data.  Thus, \\na wide variety of professions will find more uses for custom AI applications and data-derived \\ninsights than for traditional software engineering. This makes literacy in AI-oriented coding \\neven more valuable than traditional coding. It could enable countless individuals to harness \\ndata to make their lives richer.\\nI hope the promise of building basic AI applications, even more than that of building basic \\ntraditional software, encourages more people to learn how to code. If society embraces this \\nnew form of literacy as it has the ability to read and write, we will all benefit.Introduction',\n",

       " 'PAGE 8 Learning Technical \\nSkills for a Promising \\nAI CareerCHAPTER 2\\nLEARNING',\n",
       " 'PAGE 9 In the previous chapter, I introduced three key steps for building a career in AI: learning \\nfoundational technical skills, working on projects, and finding a job, all of which is supported \\nby being part of a community. In this chapter, I’d like to dive more deeply into the first step: \\nlearning foundational skills.\\nMore research papers have been published on AI than anyone can read in a lifetime. So, when \\nlearning, it’s critical to prioritize topic selection. I believe the most important topics for a technical \\ncareer in machine learning are:\\nFoundational machine learning skills: For example, it’s important to understand models such \\nas linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly \\ndetection. Beyond specific models, it’s even more important to understand the core concepts \\nbehind how and why machine learning works, such as bias/variance, cost functions, regularization, \\noptimization algorithms, and error analysis.\\nDeep learning: This has become such a large fraction of machine learning that it’s hard to excel \\nin the field without some understanding of it! It’s valuable to know the basics of neural networks, \\npractical skills for making them work (such as hyperparameter tuning), convolutional networks, \\nsequence models, and transformers.\\nSoftware development: While you can get a job and make huge contributions with only machine \\nlearning modeling skills, your job opportunities will increase if you can also write good software \\nto implement complex AI systems. These skills include programming fundamentals, data \\nstructures (especially those that relate to machine learning, such as data frames), algorithms \\n(including those related to databases and data manipulation), software design, familiarity with \\nPython, and familiarity with key libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, and scikit-learn.Math relevant to machine learning:  Key areas include linear algebra (vectors, matrices, and various \\nmanipulations of them) as well as probability and statistics (including discrete and continuous \\nprobability, standard probability distributions, basic rules such as independence and Bayes’ rule, \\nand hypothesis testing). In addition, exploratory data analysis (EDA) — using visualizations and other \\nmethods to systematically explore a dataset — is an underrated skill. I’ve found EDA particularly \\nuseful in data-centric AI development, where analyzing errors and gaining insights can really help \\ndrive progress! Finally, a basic intuitive understanding of calculus will also help. The math needed \\nto do machine learning well has been changing. For instance, although some tasks require calculus, \\nimproved automatic differentiation software makes it possible to invent and implement new neural \\nnetwork architectures without doing any calculus. This was almost impossible a decade ago.Learning Technical Skills For a Promising AI Career CHAPTER 2',\n",
       " 'PAGE 10 This is a lot to learn!\\nEven after you master everything on this list, I hope you’ll keep learning and continue to deepen \\nyour technical knowledge. I’ve known many machine learning engineers who benefitted from \\ndeeper skills in an application area such as natural language processing or computer vision, or in \\na technology area such as probabilistic graphical models or building scalable software systems.\\nHow do you gain these skills? There’s a lot of good content on the internet, and in theory, \\nreading dozens of web pages could work. But when the goal is deep understanding, reading \\ndisjointed web pages is inefficient because they tend to repeat each other, use inconsistent \\nterminology (which slows you down), vary in quality, and leave gaps. That’s why a good course \\n— in which a body of material has been organized into a coherent and logical form — is often the \\nmost time-efficient way to master a meaningful body of knowledge. When you’ve absorbed the \\nknowledge available in courses, you can switch over to research papers and other resources.\\nFinally, no one can cram everything they need to know over a weekend or even a month. Everyone I \\nknow who’s great at machine learning is a lifelong learner. Given how quickly our field is changing, \\nthere’s little choice but to keep learning if you want to keep up.\\nHow can you maintain a steady pace of learning for years? If you can cultivate the habit of \\nlearning a little bit every week, you can make significant progress with what feels like less effort.Learning Technical Skills For a Promising AI Career CHAPTER 2\\n',\n",
       " 'PAGE 11 \\nThe Best Way to Build \\na New Habit\\nOne of my favorite books is BJ Fogg’s, Tiny Habits: The Small Changes That Change \\nEverything. Fogg explains that the best way to build a new habit is to start small \\nand succeed, rather than start  too big and fail. For example, rather than trying to \\nexercise for 30 minutes a day, he recommends aspiring to do just one push-up, and \\ndoing it consistently.\\nThis approach may be helpful to those of you who want to spend more time studying. \\nIf you start by holding yourself accountable for watching, say, 10 seconds of an \\neducational video every day — and you do so consistently — the habit of studying daily \\nwill grow naturally. Even if you learn nothing in that 10 seconds, you’re establishing the \\nhabit of studying a little every day. On some days, maybe you’ll end up studying for an \\nhour or longer.',\n",

       " 'PAGE 13 Should you Learn Math to Get a Job in AI? CHAPTER 3\\nIs math a foundational skill for AI? It’s always nice to know more math! But there’s so much to \\nlearn that, realistically, it’s necessary to prioritize. Here’s how you might go about strengthening \\nyour math background.\\nTo figure out what’s important to know, I find it useful to ask what you need to know to make \\nthe decisions required for the work you want to do. At DeepLearning.AI, we frequently ask, \\n“What does someone need to know to accomplish their goals?” The goal might be building a \\nmachine learning model, architecting a system, or passing a job interview.\\nUnderstanding the math behind algorithms you use is often helpful, since it enables you to \\ndebug them. But the depth of knowledge that’s useful changes over time. As machine learning \\ntechniques mature and become more reliable and turnkey, they require less debugging, and a \\nshallower understanding of the math involved may be sufficient to make them work.\\nFor instance, in an earlier era of machine learning, linear algebra libraries for solving linear \\nsystems of equations (for linear regression) were immature. I had to understand how these \\nlibraries worked so I could choose among different libraries and avoid numerical roundoff \\npitfalls. But this became less important as numerical linear algebra libraries matured.\\nDeep learning is still an emerging technology, so when you train a neural network and the \\noptimization algorithm struggles to converge, understanding the math behind gradient \\ndescent, momentum, and the Adam  optimization algorithm will help you make better decisions. \\nSimilarly, if your neural network does something funny — say, it makes bad predictions on \\nimages of a certain resolution, but not others — understanding the math behind neural network \\narchitectures puts you in a better position to figure out what to do.\\nOf course, I also encourage learning driven by curiosity. If something interests you, go ahead \\nand learn it regardless of how useful it might turn out to be!  Maybe this will lead to a creative \\nspark or technical breakthrough.How much math do you need to know to be a machine learning engineer?',\n",

       " 'PAGE 15 One of the most important skills of an AI architect is the ability to identify ideas that are worth \\nworking on. These next few chapters will discuss finding and working on projects so you can gain \\nexperience and build your portfolio. \\nOver the years, I’ve had fun applying machine learning to manufacturing, healthcare, climate \\nchange, agriculture, ecommerce, advertising, and other industries. How can someone who’s not \\nan expert in all these sectors find meaningful projects within them? Here are five steps to help \\nyou scope projects.\\nIdentify a business problem (not an AI problem). I like to find \\na domain expert and ask, “What are the top three things \\nthat you wish worked better? Why aren’t they working yet?” \\nFor example, if you want to apply AI to climate change, you \\nmight discover that power-grid operators can’t accurately \\npredict how much power intermittent sources like wind \\nand solar might generate in the future.\\nBrainstorm AI solutions. When I was younger, I used to \\nexecute on the first idea I was excited about. Sometimes \\nthis worked out okay, but sometimes I ended up missing \\nan even better idea that might not have taken any more \\neffort to build. Once you understand a problem, you can \\nbrainstorm potential solutions more efficiently. For instance, \\nto predict power generation from intermittent sources, we \\nmight consider using satellite imagery to map the locations \\nof wind turbines more accurately, using satellite imagery \\nto estimate the height and generation capacity of wind \\nturbines, or using weather data to better predict cloud cover \\nand thus solar irradiance. Sometimes there isn’t a good AI \\nsolution, and that’s okay too.Scoping Successful AI Projects CHAPTER 4\\nStep 1\\nStep 2\\n',\n",
       " 'PAGE 16 Determine milestones. Once you’ve deemed a project sufficiently \\nvaluable, the next step is to determine the metrics to aim for. This \\nincludes both machine learning metrics (such as accuracy) and \\nbusiness metrics (such as revenue). Machine learning teams are often \\nmost comfortable with metrics that a learning algorithm can optimize. \\nBut we may need to stretch outside our comfort zone to come up \\nwith business metrics, such as those related to user engagement, \\nrevenue, and so on. Unfortunately, not every business problem can be \\nreduced to optimizing test set accuracy! If you aren’t able to determine \\nreasonable milestones, it may be a sign that you need to learn more \\nabout the problem. A quick proof of concept can help supply the \\nmissing perspective.Assess the feasibility and value of potential solutions. You can determine \\nwhether an approach is technically feasible by looking at published work, \\nwhat competitors have done, or perhaps building a quick proof of concept \\nimplementation. You can determine its value by consulting with domain \\nexperts (say, power-grid operators, who can advise on the utility of the \\npotential solutions mentioned above).\\nBudget for resources. Think through everything you’ll need to get the \\nproject done including data, personnel, time, and any integrations or \\nsupport you may need from other teams. For example, if you need funds \\nto purchase satellite imagery, make sure that’s in the budget.\\nWorking on projects is an iterative process. If, at any step, you find that the current direction is \\ninfeasible, return to an earlier step and proceed with your new understanding. Is there a domain \\nthat excites you where AI might make a difference? I hope these steps will guide you in exploring it \\nthrough project work — even if you don’t yet have deep expertise in that field.

Thus, it is fine to start small. Use early projects to learn and gradually step up to \\nbigger projects as your skills grow.\\nWhen you’re starting out, don’t expect others to hand great ideas or resources to you on a platter. \\nMany people start by working on small projects in their spare time.

Here are two distinct styles:\\nSay you’ve built a customer-service chatbot for retailers, and you think it could help restaurants, \\ntoo. Should you take time to study the restaurant market before starting development, moving \\nslowly but cutting the risk of wasting time and resources? Or jump in right away, moving \\nquickly and accepting a higher risk of pivoting or failing?\\nBoth approaches have their advocates, and the best choice depends on the situation.\\nReady, Aim, Fire tends to be superior when the cost of execution is high and a study can shed \\nlight on how useful or valuable a project could be. For example, if you can brainstorm a few \\nother use cases (restaurants, airlines, telcos, and so on) and evaluate these cases to identify \\nthe most promising one, it may be worth taking the extra time before committing to a direction.\\nReady, Fire, Aim tends to be better if you can execute at low cost and, in doing so, determine \\nwhether the direction is feasible and discover tweaks that will make it work. For example, if \\nyou can build a prototype quickly to figure out if users want the product, and if canceling or \\npivoting after a small amount of work is acceptable, then it makes sense to consider jumping \\nin quickly.

After you’ve \\nfinished, the ability to explain clearly what you accomplished will help convince others to open the \\ndoor to larger projects.\\nLeadership isn’t just for managers.  When you reach the point of working on larger AI projects that \\nrequire teamwork, your ability to lead projects will become more important, whether or not you are \\nin a formal position of leadership. Many of my friends have successfully pursued a technical rather \\nthan managerial career, and their ability to help steer a project by applying deep technical insights \\n— for example, when to invest in a new technical architecture or collect more data of a certain type \\n— allowed them to grow as leaders and also helped significantly improve the project.Building a Portfolio of Projects That Shows Skill Progression CHAPTER 6',\n",

       " 'PAGE 25 Finding a job has a few predictable steps that include selecting the companies to which you \\nwant to apply, preparing for interviews, and finally picking a role and negotiating a salary and \\nbenefits. In this chapter, I’d like to focus on a framework that’s useful for many job seekers in \\nAI, especially those who are entering AI from a different field.\\nA product manager at a tech startup who becomes a data scientist at the same company (or a \\ndifferent one) has switched roles. A marketer at a manufacturing firm who becomes a marketer \\nin a tech company has switched industries. An analyst in a financial services company who \\nbecomes a machine learning engineer in a tech company has switched both roles and industries.\\nIf you’re looking for your first job in AI, you’ll probably find switching either roles or industries \\neasier than doing both at the same time. Let’s say you’re the analyst working in financial services:If you’re considering your next job, ask yourself:\\nJob \\nSearchAre you switching roles? For example, if you’re a software engineer, \\nuniversity student, or physicist who’s looking to become a machine learning \\nengineer, that’s a role switch.\\nAre you switching industries? For example, if you work for a healthcare \\ncompany, financial services company, or a government agency and want \\nto work for a software company, that’s a switch in industries.✓\\n✓\\nIf you find a data science or machine learning job in financial services, you can continue \\nto use your domain-specific knowledge while gaining knowledge and expertise in AI. After \\nworking in this role for a while, you’ll be better positioned to switch to a tech company (if \\nthat’s still your goal).\\nAlternatively, if you become an analyst in a tech company, you can continue to use your \\nskills as an analyst but apply them to a different industry. Being part of a tech company also \\nmakes it much easier to learn from colleagues about practical challenges of AI, key skills to \\nbe successful in AI, and so on.✓\\n✓A Simple Framework for Starting You AI Job Search CHAPTER 7\\nTECHFINANCIAL \\nSERVICESRole & Industry SwitchRole Switch\\nIndustry SwitchANALYSTMACHINE LEARNING \\nENGINEER',\n",
       " 'PAGE 26 If you’re considering a role switch, a startup can be an easier place to do it than a big company. \\nWhile there are exceptions, startups usually don’t have enough people to do all the desired \\nwork. If you’re able to help with AI tasks — even if it’s not your official job — your work is likely \\nto be appreciated. This lays the groundwork for a possible role switch without needing to leave \\nthe company. In contrast, in a big company, a rigid reward system is more likely to reward you \\nfor doing your job well (and your manager for supporting you in doing the job for which you were \\nhired), but it’s not as likely to reward contributions outside your job’s scope.\\nAfter working for a while in your desired role and industry (for example, a machine learning \\nengineer in a tech company), you’ll have a good sense of the requirements for that role in that \\nindustry at a more senior level. You’ll also have a network within that industry to help you along. \\nSo future job searches — if you choose to stick with the role and industry — likely will be easier.\\nWhen changing jobs, you’re taking a step into the unknown, particularly if you’re switching either \\nroles or industries. One of the most underused tools for becoming more familiar with a new role \\nand/or industry is the informational interview.

A compelling resume, portfolio of technical projects, and \\na strong interview performance will unlock doors. Even if you have a referral from someone in a \\ncompany, a resume and portfolio will be your first contact with many people who don’t already \\nknow about you. Update your resume and make sure it clearly presents your education and \\nexperience relevant to the role you want. Customize your communications with each company \\nto explain why you’re a good fit. Before an interview, ask the recruiter what to expect. Take time \\nto review and practice answers to common interview questions, brush up key skills, and study \\ntechnical materials to make sure they are fresh in your mind. Afterward, take notes to help you \\nremember what was said.\\nProceed respectfully and responsibly. Approach interviews and offer negotiations with a win-\\nwin mindset. Outrage spreads faster than reasonableness on social media, so a story about \\nhow an employer underpaid someone gets amplified, whereas stories about how an employer \\ntreated someone fairly do not. The vast majority of employers are ethical and fair, so don’t let \\nstories about the small fraction of mistreated individuals sway your approach. If you’re leaving \\na job, exit gracefully.
