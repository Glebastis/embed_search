# embed_search
This project helps to understand how does the embedding search is processed.
In this project Hierarchical Navigable Small World technique is used. 
This technique is an Approximate nearest neigbour algorithm which allows to approximately 
find the best suited embeddings from the embedding database. The database was just cut by pieses 
of 500 chars with no any preprocessing so that is why the result of serch was not always good.
This project is done only for educational purposes to give understand of how it works.
